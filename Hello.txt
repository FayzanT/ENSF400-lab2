The tradition of using "Hello, World!" as a simple introductory program traces back to the early days of computer programming. The exact origin is a bit unclear, but it became a popular convention for writing the first program when learning a new programming language or demonstrating basic syntax.

One of the earliest known instances is from the book "The C Programming Language," written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. The first edition of the book, published in 1978, contains a "Hello, World!" example in the introduction. The use of "Hello, World!" as a beginner's program likely spread from there and became a standard way for programmers to get started with a new language.
